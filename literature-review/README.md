## Review Papers

Review papers on stock prediction: [Shah2019], [Miranda2019], [Grandhmal2019].

Shah2019 use taxonomy that break down stock prediction techniques into Statistical, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Sentiment Analysis, and Hybrid, while Gradhmal2019 taxonomy has prediction and classification. Miranda2019 also group into two classes: prediction and clustering.

These review papers showed that machine learning methods had been investigated extensively in the application domain.

Feature Selection and LSTM Forecasting Model (Niu2020)  
Technical Indicators and Input Window Length (Shynkevich2017)  
SVR for daily price prediction (Henrique2018)  
Stock Selection and Portfolio Construction (Wang2020)  
LSTM for direction (Fischer & Krauss, 2018)  
DNN for direction (Krauss 2017)  
Compare forecasting techniques based on two categories and grouping stocks into four groups  (Mosavi2020)
